🚀 Senior Backend / Full-Stack Engineer | Co-Founder | Crypto & Fintech Builder

I'm a software engineer with 5+ years of hands-on experience building and deploying production-grade systems across crypto, fintech, and mobile payments. I specialize in Python (Django), PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs, and infrastructure automation — but what I truly do is build **platforms that scale and deliver real value.**

💼 I’ve led backend engineering for:
- **Zedi**: A crypto > fiat deposit platform built for instant local currency payouts – https://zedi.app
- **Cointag**: A mobile money wallet platform that allows users to accept and use crypto seamlessly – https://cointag.app
- **Mybitstore**: A live crypto trading platform with fiat/crypto integrations, KYC, and Bitcoin node infrastructure.

From integrating full/pruned Bitcoin nodes to architecting REST APIs, launching mobile apps, and configuring secure servers, I bring both startup hustle and senior-level software thinking.

🌍 Open to **remote senior engineering roles**, **fintech or crypto platforms**, or **founder-led startups** where I can make real impact.

📩 Let’s connect! Available for interesting problems, open-source collabs, or remote roles.
